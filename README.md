# CMPT432N-JSCompiler
Design Of Compilers - Marist College - Dr. Labouseur

The scope of this project is to create a compiler from scratch and is broken up into four phases. Each phase will make up a branch in this repository along with the relevant Lab work.

# Setup
Editing and running this project is easy in many text editors. I recommend Visual Studio because of the extensions it offers and how beneficial they can be.

# Running the Compiler
To run the compiler, simply open 'index.html'.

# CMPT432N-JavaScript Compiler
Design Of Compilers - Marist College - Dr. Labouseur

The scope of this project is to create a compiler from scratch and is broken up into four phases. Each phase will make up a branch in this repository along with the relevant Lab work (Upon the semester ending, I have moved the work from the development branches into this branch).

# Setup
Editing this project is as easy as opening it in your favorite text editor. I recommend Visual Studio because of the extensions it offers for JavaScript and how beneficial they can be.

# Running the Compiler
To run the compiler, simply open 'index.html'.
